PrimitiveTypes Chapter4
==========================
1) Reset  the lowermost set Bit  x&(x-1)
2) Extract the lowermost set Bit  x&~(x-1)
3) To Swap a bit XOR with 1 ( 0 ^1 = 1, 1^1 = 0)
4) To Forward the rightmost set bit  x | (x-1)
5) Last n bits will be the reminder when doing the modulo operation with 2^n
6) To Check if x is Power of 2 !(x & (x-1))
7) XOR operation is assocative & Commutative
   Associative A + (B+C) = (A+B)+C
   Commutative A+B = B+A
8) Consider using cached results when trying to improve Time Complexity of Bit related problems.
   Examples: Reverse Bits in an integer, Parity of a number.
9) When working with Bitwise operators be mindful of precedence. 
   Just to be safe include parentheses wherever possible to avoid any issues caused by precedence of operators.
 
Arrays Chapter5
=======================
1) Numbers > 1 and divisible only by itself is a prime number.
To test if A is a prime number you need to check if it is divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to sqrt(A)
